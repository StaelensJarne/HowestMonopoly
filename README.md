# Monopoly

This project was part of bachelor applied informatics.

- Module Project I
- Partim Programming

The project was initially designed for the .NET Core framework.

But I recently updated the project to the full .NET Framework. This has several reasons:

1) The project was initially developed 2 years ago back in my bachelor. \
But when I recently came back to the project, the project didn't compile anymore.
2) I had to struggle with (depricated) dependencies and other conflicts in the Nuget packages to compile the project again.
3) I want the project to be sustainable over time. I don't plan to actively develop it futher. \
When I come back to the project in the future I want to run it normally.

[Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) was used to develop this project. \
And [Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) for the database.
